# 🔓 Real-World Attack Simulation Lab

This repository documents several offensive security attacks I performed in a **controlled lab environment** using Kali Linux, vulnerable machines, and real Wi-Fi hardware. These attacks were part of my independent cybersecurity learning following HackerU's ethical hacking curriculum.

Each attack includes:

- 🎯 Objectives  
- 🛠️ Tools used  
- 🧪 Step-by-step commands  
- 📸 Screenshots  
- ✅ Results

## 📁 Included Attacks

### 🧠 1. [EternalBlue Exploit (MS17-010) + Screenshot via Meterpreter](attacks/eternalblue-metasploit/)
- Used Metasploit to scan and exploit a Windows 7 machine vulnerable to EternalBlue.
- Gained a reverse Meterpreter shell.
- Took a screenshot from the victim machine as proof of access.

### 📡 2. [Evil Twin Wi-Fi Attack using Airgeddon + Alfa Adapter](attacks/evil-twin-airgeddon/)
- Created a rogue access point with the same SSID as a real Wi-Fi network.
- Deauthenticated users from the real AP.
- Captured WPA handshake and credentials using a phishing portal.

### 🔄 3. [MITM Attack (ARP Spoofing + HTTP Credential Sniffing)](attacks/mitm-arp-http-sniffing/) 
- Manually enabled IP forwarding.
- Used `arpspoof` and `tcpdump`/`wireshark` to capture credentials from HTTP login pages.

### 🐴 4. [Trojan Horse Attack – Fake AnyDesk Installer](attacks/trojan-anydesk-delivery/)
- Crafted a Trojan payload named `AnyDeskPro.exe` using `msfvenom`, embedded in a real AnyDesk binary.
- Hosted the file via a simple Python3 HTTP server with no actual web content.
- Used AnyDesk to simulate remote attacker access to the victim machine.
- Once the victim ran the fake installer, a reverse Meterpreter shell was opened on the attacker's Kali machine.

## 📌 About

These labs reflect my practical experience in:
- Network attacks (MITM, DoS)
- Exploiting known CVEs (EternalBlue)
- Wi-Fi hacking (Evil Twin, EAPOL capture)
- Trojan horse attacks using social engineering
- Post-exploitation with Metasploit

> 🛠 Tools used: Kali Linux, Metasploit, Airgeddon, Alfa AWUS036ACH, Airodump-ng, Arpspoof, msfvenom, Python3 HTTP server
